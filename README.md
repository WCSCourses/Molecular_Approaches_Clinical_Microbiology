# Summary

The wind of change is blowing through clinical microbiology, not just in Africa but across the globe. Molecular techniques are revolutionising the routine identification and characterisation of pathogens, opening new opportunities and challenges in all areas of clinical microbiology from clinical diagnostics to fundamental research. This course will examine the impact of molecular approaches in the African context using a combination of lectures and tutorials and laboratory and computer practical sessions. The course will focus on bacterial pathogens of importance in Africa.

The intensive programme will provide clinical microbiologists and laboratory scientists working in Africa with a concise yet comprehensive overview of the latest research and practice in this essential area, with an emphasis on how these techniques can be applied day-to-day in an African setting, especially when resources are limited. There will be extensive opportunity to interact with the course faculty during the course.

The course will concentrate on approaches which are:

- currently applicable in African laboratories.
- likely to be applicable in Africa in the foreseeable future, including whole genome sequencing (WGS) using portable devices.
- of value to participants in interpreting the literature and assessing the likely utility of new technologies as they are developed.

The course is aimed at those primarily trained in culture-based microbiology and combines an understanding of the latest research techniques and theoretical approaches, with practical methods to provide a foundation-level of understanding of the philosophy, methods, and specialist terminology of molecular techniques.

The week-long course will be held at, and in collaboration, with the [Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI)](https://www.kemri.go.ke/). The course is free to attend and open to applicants based in institutes in Africa.

# Target Audience

Applicants should have demonstrable experience in a relevant field (microbiology, specifically bacteriology) and be, clinical trainees or specialists in medical microbiology; postdoctoral scientists; senior technicians; or research assistants with a Master’s degree. Clinically qualified applicants are especially encouraged to apply.

# Programme

Teaching will be based around three themes, chosen to represent three of the most pressing clinical imperatives in clinical bacteriology throughout the continent:

- Mycobacterium tuberculosis
- Enteric bacteria and antimicrobial resistance
- Encapsulated bacteria and vaccination

For each of these themes the following approaches will be covered:

- Fundamental molecular biology techniques including preparing, handling, and storing DNA.
- PCR, including real-time PCR, with an emphasis on methods, applications and data interpretation.
- Determining sequence variation, its visualisation and interpretation, concentrating on conventional approaches.
- Bioinformatic analysis of molecular and genomic data, particularly the exploitation of web-based tools.
- An overview of future technologies, and their potential for application in clinical microbiology.

These techniques will be explored in the lectures and tutorials and employed during the course practical sessions in the cross-cutting themes of pathogen detection and characterisation, including antimicrobial resistance and the evolution of pathogens, and the application of the data in the improvement of interventions to reduce disease burden.

# Learning Outcomes

After attending this course, participants will be able to:

- Assess the strengths, weaknesses and limitations of different methodologies and approaches in clinical microbiology.
- Appreciate utility of molecular techniques in clinical laboratory and bacteriological methods and their transferability to other applications.
- Apply a range of genomic methods including real-time PCR and conventional sequencing.
- Create sequence data using next generation single molecule sequencing.
- Analyse genomic data using publicly available software tools to identify causative organisms in an infection and to track an outbreak using WGS.
